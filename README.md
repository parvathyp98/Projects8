# Android Mobile App with Handwriting Recognition

Handwritten Text Recognition system trained on the IAM off-line HTR dataset. This Neural Network (NN) model recognizes the text contained in the images of segmented words as shown in the illustration below. As these word-images are smaller than images of complete text-lines, the NN can be kept small and training on the CPU is feasible. 3/4 of the words from the validation-set are correctly recognized and the character error rate is around 10%.
